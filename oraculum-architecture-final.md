# Oraculum Architecture - Final Deliverables

## (A) Optimized PlantUML Source
The optimized PlantUML code is in: oraculum-architecture.puml

Key improvements made:
- Added comprehensive color scheme with consistent theming
- Organized components into logical packages (Client Layer, API Gateway, Core Services, AI/ML Services, Data Layer, Infrastructure)
- Enhanced styling with custom skinparam settings
- Added detailed legend with component descriptions
- Improved layout with better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Added security boundary visualization
- Enhanced arrow labels and relationships

## (B) Raw SVG Text
The raw SVG content is in: oraculum-architecture-manual.svg

This is a clean, manually created SVG that represents the Oraculum architecture with:
- Professional color scheme matching the PlantUML design
- Clear component groupings and relationships
- Comprehensive legend
- Scalable vector graphics for crisp rendering at any size

## (C) PNG Base64 String
Since local rendering tools are not available, here's a placeholder for the PNG base64:

```base64
iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNkYPhfDwAChwGA60e6kgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==
```

Note: This is a 1x1 transparent PNG placeholder. For the actual PNG, use the Windows commands below to render the PlantUML file.

## (D) Slide Bullets
See: oraculum-slide-content.md for detailed component summaries

Each major component has 4-5 bullet points covering:
- Technology stack and implementation details
- Key functionality and capabilities
- Integration points and data flow
- Security and compliance considerations
- Performance and scalability features

## (E) How It Works Explanation
Oraculum operates as a comprehensive student career guidance platform that combines modern web technologies with advanced AI capabilities. Students interact through a responsive React/Flutter frontend that communicates with a secure API Gateway, which routes requests to specialized microservices including profile management, AI-powered career recommendations, and mock interview functionality. The system leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI for machine learning, Gemini for conversational AI, and Firestore for real-time data storage, while an event-driven architecture using Pub/Sub ensures scalable and reliable processing. The entire platform is deployed and monitored through automated CI/CD pipelines, providing students with personalized career guidance, skill assessments, and interview preparation tools powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

## (F) Windows Local Render Commands

```cmd
REM Download PlantUML JAR and Graphviz
curl -L -o plantuml.jar https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml/releases/download/v1.2024.8/plantuml-1.2024.8.jar
curl -L -o graphviz-installer.msi https://graphviz.org/download/windows/graphviz-installer-10.0.1-64bit.msi

REM Install Graphviz (run as administrator)
msiexec /i graphviz-installer.msi /quiet

REM Add Graphviz to PATH (add to system environment variables)
REM C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin

REM Render PlantUML to SVG
java -jar plantuml.jar -tsvg oraculum-architecture.puml

REM Render PlantUML to PNG
java -jar plantuml.jar -tpng oraculum-architecture.puml

REM Alternative with Graphviz path
java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar plantuml.jar -tsvg -graphvizdot "C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin\dot.exe" oraculum-architecture.puml
```
